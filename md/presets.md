# Eternity builds

`Build` - a list of time studies designed for some point.  

`Preset` - exactly like in the game, a build that can be stashed
in one of the 6 preset slots.

## Preset builds

Presets 1 to 3 are minimum required builds to complete ECs 11 and 12.  
Any spare theorems may be invested for faster completion.

### P1

EC 11 (1, 2 & 3)

``` JS
11,21,22,31,32,42,41,33,51,61,62,71,81,91,101,111,
121,131,141,151,161,162,171,181,191,192,193,213,212,
211,222,225,231,233|0
```

### P2

EC 11 (4 & 5)

``` JS
11,21,22,31,32,41,42,33,51,61,62,71,81,91,101,111,
123,133,143,151,161,162,171,181,191,193,213,212,211,
192,222,223,225,233,231|0
```

### P3

EC 12

``` JS
11,21,22,32,31,41,42,33,51,61,62,73,83,93,103,111,
122,132,142,151,161,162,171,181,191,193,211,212,213,
214,222,224,226,227,234,232|0
```

### P4

ECs 4 & 8

``` JS
11,21,22,31,32,41,42,33,51,62,61,73,83,93,103,111,
123,133,143,151,161,162,171,181,191,193,211,212,213,
214,222,224,225,232,228,234,192,201,72,82,92,102,71,
81,91,101|0
```

### P5

EC 1

``` JS
11,21,22,31,32,33,41,42,51,61,62,72,82,92,102,111,
121,131,141,151,161,162,171,181,191,193,211,212,213,
214,222,224,225,228,232,234,192,201,73,83,93,103,71,
81,91,101|0
```

### P6

ECs 2, 5, 6 & 9 (if doesn't work, swap time for infinity)

``` JS
11,21,22,31,32,33,41,42,51,61,62,73,83,93,103,111,
121,131,141,151,161,162,171,181,191,193,211,212,213,
214,222,224,232,228,234,225,192,201,72,82,92,102,71,
81,91,101|0
```

### P7

EC 3 (needed only until reality)

``` JS
11,21,22,31,32,33,41,42,51,61,62,71,81,91,101,111,
122,132,142,151,161,162,171,181,191,193,211,212,213,
214,222,224,232,225,228,234,192,201,72,82,92,102,73,
83,93,103|0
```

## Additional builds

Last stages of the eternity phase are built around __Light__
and __Dark__ paths. Most of them can be useful at certain point
around ECs 11 & 12.

`Note:` *all __Dark__ paths are preferable except may be study `225`*.
