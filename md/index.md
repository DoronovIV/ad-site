# Guide

Since the __Reality__ release it has become really tedious for me to keep
in memory all the gimmicks for each stage of the game loop.

The [official wiki guide](https://antimatter-dimensions.fandom.com/wiki/Guide)
has helped me a lot with the eternity phase, however
when I tried to follow it on the reality one, I've found out that it's not
as straightforward and I've progressed a while intuitively (which seldom
happens).  

This article might be helpful for one who has complete the game at least
once and generally knows what he's doing at each stage before at least
eternity stage.

## Eternity

### General

Initially, focus eternity count to get all the milestones for automation.

### ECs

Eternity challenges retain mainly with the completion order they impose.
Most of them have a specific flow as well.

### The six-preset approach

Having 6 presets total, we can make a table for the ECs as a second axis.

There was an ai-generated md-table but I found it ugly so I've come up with
a dictionary-like list. Here on the left side you can find challenge numbers,
while on the right side - preset number.

`Note` that EC11 requires two slightly different builds for full 5
completions: first two or three with __Active__ and last couple with
__*Idle*__ paths.

1     -  5  
2     -  6  
3     -  7 (ad+pas)  
4     -  4  
5     -  6  
6     -  6  
7     -  1  
8     -  4  
9     -  6  
10    -  1  
11-A  -  1  
11-P  -  2  
12    -  3  

The list of presets can be found in [presets](presets.md) file.

TODO

## Reality

`RM` - reality machines - the main currency of the stage.

`GS` - glyph set - the build of glyphs.

`cel` - celestial.

### Glyph type aliases

`P` - power,  
`I` - infinity,  
`R` - replicanti,  
`T` - time,  
`D` - dilation,  

later,  
`E` - effarig.

Most glyphs have total of *4 properties* on them.

Due to how those properties are aligned at the glyph icon,
intuitively I've split them into 4 categories:

`L`-shaped,  
`Г`-shaped,  
`rL`-shaped: reverse 'L', like `.:`,  
`rГ`-shaped: reverse 'Г'. like `':`.

### First bunch of perks

Probably the most important thing about hitting the reality button
is perks. I've started it two times at this point, and the ideal way
I see it is next:

`Note:` Get `Existentially Prolong` (15 reality machines study)
as soon as possible. It will allow you to skip manual C9, IC4 and IC5.
__*This is the key quality of life improvement*__.

Since first 5-10 realities are going to be slow, about 24hrs, you should
rush for the `start each new reality with N ad/ip/ep` path.

Then, as realities become shorter and you are able to skip some parts,
go straight up achievement one.

### First glyphs

The objective is: __*keeping all 3/4/5 glyph slots filled at all time*__.
Therefore, at fourth reality, save some RMs for the fourth glyph slot
and make sure you unlock that upgrade.

Doesn't matter the glyph type, try getting as higher rarity and lvl
as possible.

### Automation scripts

A huge topics. All the scripts will be compiled in
[automation](.automation) file.

## Cel 1 - Teresa

`TODO:` describe the main progression glyph sets as well as celestial
reality GS and tactics.

## Cel 2 - Effarig (Giraffe :P)

`TODO:` describe the three reality challenges GS, studies and
tactics.
