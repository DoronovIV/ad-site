# Guide

Since the __Reality__ release it has become really tedious for me to keep
in memory all the gimmicks for each stage of the game loop.

The [official wiki guide](https://antimatter-dimensions.fandom.com/wiki/Guide)
has helped me a lot with the eternity phase, however
when I tried to follow it on the reality one, I've found out that it's not
as straightforward and I've progressed a while intuitively (which seldom
happens).  

This article might be helpful for one who has complete the game at least
once and generally knows what he's doing at each stage before at least
eternity stage.
